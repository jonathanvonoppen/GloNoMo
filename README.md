# GloNoMo - Code Repository

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the **GloNoMo** project (Global status, trends, drivers and impacts of non-native plant species in mountain ecosystems).
GloNoMo is funded by an ERC Starting Grant to Sabine Rumpf at the [Ecology Group](https://eco.duw.unibas.ch), Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Basel, Switzerland.

The repository is currently maintained by [Jonathan von Oppen](https://jonathanvonoppen.net).

# License
**The code and data in this repository is currently not publicly available.** If you have been granted access, please treat everything contained in this repository as confidential. If you would like to share or make any of the content public please contact [Sabine Rumpf](mailto:sabine.rumpf@unibas.ch).

# File Structure
The repository follows a simple folder structure:

* All data is deposited in the */data* folder. *Note that all data should normally be stored on University servers, i.e. in PUMA/projects/GloNoMo/data*
* All scripts are deposited in the */scripts* folder.

Please feel free to create your own folder with your name in the */scripts* folder to store your scripts. E.g. */scripts/jonathan*. If you add new data to the */data* folder, please first consider whether the data *has* to go on GitHub (rather than on our PUMA), and update the readme in the */data* folder accordingly. If you need help with GitHub's markdown, click [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

# 3 Simple Tips for Successful Code Sharing
1. Push and pull frequently.
2. Commit in small chunks.
3. When working on a shared project, always pull before editing a script.

## What to do when merging conflicts arise
* Don't panic.
* If you feel comfortable to resolve the issue, do it yourself.
* If in doubt, contact Jonathan. 

## Happy sharing!
